# Week Review

## 2016-01-10
### Focus - DevOps and JS, continue the momentum.

## Accomplishments:
- [x] Complete training on Node.js course (JS skills)
 - Completed the Node.js course which brought a lot of clarity to my current knowledge using Node.js.
- [x] Start training on Angular.js course (JS skills)
 - So far I'm at about 50% completed. I haven't used Angular.js in the past before but throguh the training I like how similar it is to my previous experience in using View Models. Seems a little more straight forward than React.js that I currently use on my project. It gets me interested to understand what some of the new functionality will be released in Angular.js 2.0
 - [ ] Complete two chapters in Continuous Delivery (DevOps)
 - [ ] Setup Docker on local machine (DevOps)
