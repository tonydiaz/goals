### Take cloud certification exam; determine the next goal.
- [ ] Read one chapter in Continuous Deployment
- [ ] Take on one future item in the list

## Accomplishments:
- [x] Take cloud certification exam
 - I took the certification exam this week and passed. It was great to achieve this certification and allows me to have more time work on some of my other goals. This one took up a lot of time early this year to get prepared.
- [x] Determine next goal to achieve
 - At work the team has been using React.js for a few areas of the code. Recently we decided to start building out new functionality in React.js exclusively so I think the next area to focus on is learning React.js. I had signed up for a course on Udemy a while back and plan to begin taking that one.
