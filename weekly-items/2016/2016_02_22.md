# Week Review

## 2016-02-22
### Take cloud certification exam; determine the next goal.

## Accomplishments:
- [x] Take cloud certification exam
 - I took the certification exam this week and passed. It was great to achieve this certification and allows me to have more time work on some of my other goals. This one took up a lot of time early this year to get prepared.
- [x] Determine next goal to achieve
 - At work the team has been using React.js for a few areas of the code. Recently we decided to start building out new functionality in React.js exclusively so I think the next area to focus on is learning React.js. I had signed up for a course on Udemy a while back and plan to begin taking that one.
- [x] Take on one future item in the list
 - Installed VIsual Studio Code. I'm on vacaton the following week so I will start to use it at work in a week.
## Additional items:

## Things I didn't get to / things to focus on in the future:
- [ ] Read one chapter in Continuous Deployment

## Week in Review:
It was a good week to begin to get back on track. I was able to pass the certification something I spent a good amount of time the beginning  of this year to get to accomplish.
