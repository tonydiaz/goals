## Week in Review:
I was able to complete a good number of the items I wanted to work on this week. I think it is because I have been keeping up with my goals list each day. I attempted to start looking at my github project again this week and was able to get to the Authorization screen but running in to an issues with the POST that comes back from GitHub.

I was able to get through Domain 4 in the AWS certification training making it halfway through the Domains. It hasn't been anything super hard. I think it will be more memorization than anything.

I didn't get a chance to get to my patent disclosure but will roll it over to next week.
