## Week in Review:
I was off of work for a week and focused on the AWS professional certification. I completed all of the items on my plan. I took the practice exam this week and completely bombed the practice exam. I decided after that to focus my time to recertify my associate certification instead of upgrade to the professional level at this time.

A few reasons for that:
 - Currently not working with AWS. It is a lot harder to understand AWS when you don't work with it day-to-day.
 - Training available: the training I chose wasn't that good to overcome the fact that I don't use AWS at this time.
 - Time commitment: The time to come up to speed on the specifics on each AWS service would cut it too close to when my current certification would expire.
 - Benefit: As I'm not currently working in AWS I wouldn't get any career benefit by having this certification at this time.

 I'll update my AWS plan in case next year I decide to pursue the professional certification.
