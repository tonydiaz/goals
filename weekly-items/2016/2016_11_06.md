## Week in Review:
Lost steam on working towards my AWS cert. I wasn't able to finish all the items to get prepped for the certification exam. Will try to accomplish these the following week which means it will push out my certification another week unfortunately. I should target the certification to be the week of Thanksgiving. All the other items will have to wait since I'm so far behind.
