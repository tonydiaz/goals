##  2016-09-18

## Accomplishments:
### More focus complete section 6 in React training.
- [x] Complete 2 chapters in Soft Skills book

## Additional items:
- [x] Add PDU courses to next week. Another 5-10 PDUs.
- [x] Select next book to start reading

## Things I didn't get to / things to focus on in the future:
- [ ] Complete section 6 in ReactJS course - only two videos left
- [ ] Get authorization working for github project

## Week in Review:
Started late getting back on my goals. Hope next week is more productive. Still need to complete two videos in React to complete the course and develop a project using react, which will be a Github todo list. Also decided to do some work to earn some PDUs, my certification expires next year and I will need to get those to re-certify. After this week I should focus on re-certifying on AWS, those have a quicker expiration (every 2 years). I plan to update to the professional certification.

Next week I will also be developing a plan to reach the professional certification for the Solutions Architecture
