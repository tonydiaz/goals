## Week in Review:
Tried to focus on the AWS training mainly this week since I'm behind on the schedule I had setup originally. I completed up to Domain 7. I'll focus on the rest of the training next week. Just going to roll over the other tasks I didn't get to next week.

I was also able to get one of my Digital blog posts up on the website. Increasing social presence as IBM would put it.
