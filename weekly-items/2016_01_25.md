## Week in Review:
Feels good to complete all the tasks I setup for the week. One was difficult to get started but once I started it wasn't too hard too bad to complete. Ii was surprised I was able to complete the whole course for IBM Bluemix but it was shorter than I initially thought. Looking forward to keeping up the momentum.
