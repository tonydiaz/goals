# Week Review

## 2016-02-08
### Focus - Get focus back on completing tasks, catch up from last week


## Accomplishments:
- [x] Complete one chapter in Continuous Delivery (DevOps)
 - Completed chapter 7 which is a lot shorter than the previous chapters. Going to try to go for two chapters this week.
- [x] Complete Bluemix certification course (Cloud tech)
 - I completed the course minus a few sample exam questions that I will save until after I complete the next course. The course took me longer than expected and wasn't as polished as I would have liked but it was free so I can't complain. I did provide feedback on the errors I saw throughout the course.
- [x] Review Bluemix practice exam (Cloud tech) http://public.dhe.ibm.com/partnerworld/pub/certify/samC5020-285.pdf
 - Completed the 11 question quiz and got 7 correct. Not a very good score.
- [x] Start the cloud certification course prep from IBM (Cloud tech)
 - Started the course and completed Module 1.

## Week in Review:
It is good to get a number of my tasks accomplished for the week. I'm about two weeks before taking the IBM cloud application developer certification. I plan to keep walking through the material for the exam.
