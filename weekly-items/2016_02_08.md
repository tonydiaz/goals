## 2016-02-08
### Focus - Get focus back on completing tasks, catch up from last week
- [ ] Complete one chapter in Continuous Delivery (DevOps)
- [x] Complete Bluemix certification course (Cloud tech)
- [ ] Start the cloud certification course prep from IBM (Cloud tech)
- [ ] Review Bluemix practice exam (Cloud tech) http://public.dhe.ibm.com/partnerworld/pub/certify/samC5020-285.pdf

## Accomplishments:
- [x] Complete Bluemix certification course (Cloud tech)
 - I completed the course minus a few sample exam questions that I will save until after I complete the next course. The course took me longer than expected and wasn't as polished as I would have liked but it was free so I can't complain. I did provide feedback on the errors I saw throughout the course.
