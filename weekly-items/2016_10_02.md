## Week in Review:
I was able to complete the first domain for AWS this week and was surprised how much information I remember from the Solutions Architect - Associate exam I remember. Some things haven't changed in AWS in the past two years! I was also able to get through another chapter in the book Clean code, I can tell this book has a lot of beneficial information.

I did upload my resume to Office 365, there is no point in storing my resume on my computer where I can only access it when I'm on the computer. These days many people have multiple computers and transferring files from one device to another is old-school. I was also able to try out Trello, again have more of a single place to remember to track and keep tasks that need to be done is great just haven't gotten in to this tool much. Will continue to try it out. I'm suffering a little from too many tools to use at the moment.
