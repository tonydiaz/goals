## Week in Review:
More like moths in review. Since I have been updating this repo. I have still worked at a high level to accomplish my goals. I have been able to get all of my re-certifications completed in the first half of the year, which is 1/3 of the goals I posted.

During this time also I have been working on my second goal of building more things. I was able to build and launch a site it is called POTUS Postcard (https://www.potuspostcard.com). The web app was built using React and Node.js. I have it hosted on AWS ElasticBeanstalk. It is using third-party APIs to get data and provide the service. It has all been a great learning experience. It hasn't gained a lot of popularity though people say it was a good idea.
