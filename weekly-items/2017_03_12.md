## Week in Review:
Restarting the weekly progress. I was able to get my AWS recertification for the Solution Architect at the end of February. I haven't been able to keep up with my goals since other responsibilities have been taking more time.

Also decided to not re-certify my AWS developer certification since I felt it was a bit redundant with the AWS solution architect certification.
