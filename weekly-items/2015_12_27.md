# Week Review

## Accomplishments:
- [x] Integrate Travis CI in a github project. -DevOps
 - I create a skeleton nods project generate from Yeomon to accomplish this item. Integration with TravisCI through github is fairly straightforward.

 - When beginning to approach this task I started to investigate the best way to create a NodeJS template I came across site generators. This seemed like the best way to get the template up and running.

 - Added information on the certification in a separate file. I wasn't able to find any specific training for this certification so I will hold off on this certification until there is more information on completing the cert.
