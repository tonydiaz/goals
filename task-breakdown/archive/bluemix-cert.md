# Bluemix Cloud Application Developer certification

The amount or time it will take to become familiar with bluemix and proficient in using it will take a good amount of time. Without any direct training to understand the requirements for the certification I need a plan to get be able to become knowledgeable. The plan will evolve as I become more knowledgeable.
